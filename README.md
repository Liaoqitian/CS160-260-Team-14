## Understanding Users and Competitive Analysis  
Our target user group is mainly first generation immigrants, who wish to find a connection to their home country, and possibly a new community. We interviewed three users from this target group.  
User 1 is a 23 year old, originally from China, who lives in San Diego. They are always on the lookout for authentic Chinese food, but have also grown to love  some of the popular Mexican cuisine offerings in California. Their favorite hometown dish is duck blood vermicelli. Everywhere they travel in America, they look for recommendations for good Chinese restaurants to try. They like using Yelp to get reviews on casual eats. They prioritize looking for bad reviews on the first results page to eliminate choices. However, I don't like the experience Yelp offers when trying to find authentic spots. For these, they rely more on recommendations from friends or some extensive research using Google. They usually don't like to try Chinese restaurants unless they are recommended by people they know. They feel like most of American Chinese restaurants are basically Panda Express like".  
User 2 is a 25 year old, originally from Taiwan, who has lived in the US for about 7 years. Their favorite hometown dish is sticky tofu. They usually go to restaurants they already know and love, but when traveling they like to use Yelp. Their favorite feature in Yelp is the recommended dish list displayed for some places. They usually prioritize choosing a restaurant to eat in based on seeing familiar dishes in that list over other metrics. However, they don't rely on Yelp to find authentic Taiwanese eats. The recognize that the best way to find an authentic spot on Yelp is to look for 3 star reviewed spots. They don't like how much the service reviews weight for these restaurants, as it is expected that in these places language barriers exist, which are certain to make for a worse service experience.  
User 3 is a 27 year old, originally from Israel, who lived in New York City for 3 years. Their favorite hometown foods are hummus plates and falafel. They enjoy exploring the many culinary options available in NYC, especially authentic Asian restaurants of all kinds. They usually get recommendations for authentic Mediteranian food from friends and folks at the local community center. They usually find authentic Asian restaurants through friends or exploring in the city. They also prioritize authentic experience over proximity. Both of their favorite authentic restaurants are far away from where they live. They dislike the general bias against service in authentic restaurants.

## Low-Fidelity Prototypes and Wireframes
Immigrants have a hard time finding authentic restaurants that stay true to the taste of home they are longing for, as such restaurants are often poorly rated on popular apps such as Yelp, due to language and culture barriers. Our app offers a restaurant search service, which focuses on authenticity related reviews using machine learning techniques.  
The three primary tasks we selected are:
1. Choosing a cuisine type: At its heart, our app aims at helping users find authentic restaurants of a particular cuisine. This is also the first task users interact with when opening the app.
2. Sorting: After choosing a cuisine type, users are able to sort the results by authenticity or by distance. Again, the goal of the app is for users to find authentic restaurants around them. However, based on our interviews we realized that sometimes users are willing to travel extensively to get the best authentic experience. So we are providing an option to sort restaurants by authenticity as well.
3. Rating authenticity (thumbs up/down): Our app filters out Yelp reviews related to service or environment and aggregates only reviews based on taste. We also use Googleâ€™s ML sentiment analysis to rate different restaurants. However, to provide better results, we allow users to give their authenticity rate. Additionally, from our interviews, we realized that users want a simple way to indicate authenticity (as opposed to lengthy Yelp reviews). As a result we chose a rating mechanism that is simple enough (binary), to encourage users to leave a review.
